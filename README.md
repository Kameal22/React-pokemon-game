# React Pokemon game with PokeApi, React hooks, context, router.

## This is my last project after taking the Colt Steele's Udemy course. There was a different app suggested but I've decided to create this one.

### It's my first use of Hooks in a bigger project, also applying React's Context + Router (params, redirecting) to grasp their rules and learn them in pratice. Game itself contains things like turn-based fighting, looting items after win, healing pokemons, catching enemy pokemons using a pokeball. Gathering pokemons in Pokedex and then using them in fights. Also You can level up your character after gaining enough experience.
